# QrCodeReader

This JavaScript code creates a QR code scanner application. Users upload a QR code file and scan it by sending it to an API. The content of the scanned QR code can be copied to the text field and users can copy this text to the clipboard.

How does it work?

1. Users select a QR code file by clicking the "Select File" button.

2. The selected file is processed by JavaScript and added to a FormData object.

3. The FormData object is used to make a POST request to an API.

4. The API scans the submitted QR code file and returns the result in JSON format.

5. The content of the scanned QR code is added to the text field and displayed to the user.

6. Users can click the "Copy" button to copy the text to the clipboard.

7. Users can click the "Close" button to close the window.
